ExaCAM: low-cost high-speed USB2.02.0 stereo camera project

This project attempts to build a low-cost stereoscopic camera. Currently the idea is to use a Cypress FX2LP board to communicate to PCB camera modules, which will be synchronized by hardware. The current modules that are to be tested are Omnivision OV7670 (max. resolution 640x480@30FPS).

Project is in initial planning phase, stay tuned.
